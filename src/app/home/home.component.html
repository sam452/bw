      <h1>Welcome to Bent Whisker Ranch!</h1>
      <p>We're happy for your visit and are thrilled to share our mission and success stories with you! We've been animal (especially cat) lovers all our lives, so we finally decided to make it official and launch a non-profit dedicated to animal welfare!</p>
 
      <p>Be sure to visit our Past Successes section to see examples of how fostering saves lives!</p>
 
      <p>While you're here, please consider making a donation. All money received goes toward veterinary care expenses, including medications; cat food and litter; humane traps (for Trap/Neuter/Return); and more. Thank you for your support! We couldn't do it without your help.</p>

      <p>Our adoption process consists of a meet and greet, completed adoption application and a small adoption fee. Want more information about these two cuties? Email me today: <a href="mailto:becky@bentwhiskerranch.org">-bw</a></p>

      Bent Whisker is named for the older animals, particularly cats 
      who have to fend for themselves and live the 
      rough life, as evidenced by how some of their
      whiskers end up getting bent for reasons house-bound
      animals do not.
